Global Game Jam 2021 - Lost&amp;Found

Lost & Found (WIP) is a game where you work as a clerk at a "Lost and Found"-office.

People will come to you and ask for objects they have lost or misplaced and it is your job to figure out if you have the right item in your office.

If the person's description matches the item in stock, you swipe right. If not, swipe left.

The game is over when the timer up top runs out. Good luck, and have fun!
